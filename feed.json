            "content_html": "<p>This is one of the very few times where I bought a game as it was newly-released, and also the ONLY case so far where I bought an entire new console to play it on (It's a Switch exclusive, and I really did not want to pirate it or emulate it - I'm glad I didn't)</p>\n<p>Was it worth it? Absolutely. I'm going to elaborate on why, but before that, if it's not obvious already: <strong>SPOILERS AHEAD!</strong> If you haven't played this yet, and have any kind of interest to, <em>please, please play it first.</em></p>\n<h2>Before Dread</h2>\n<p>I already considered myself a Metroid fan, long before Dread was announced. I started with Super, and was content with playing through that alone a long time ago. It's left an impression on me, an excellent game that uses design and detailing to make it not only an immersive experience, but also one that doesn't leave you lost, without ever being told where to go. There's only one instance I recall where I had to look for a bit of help, and that's honestly fine.</p>\n<p>After Dread got announced, and particularly after hearing so much about it being a great title, I decided I would bite the bullet, all while experiencing Zero Mission and Fusion for the first time. I love those games a lot, too. Sure, they're more linear than Super, and you <em>are </em>told where to go quite often, but that's fine by me. </p>\n<p>Especially after playing those two games, back to back, it revalidated my love for the series, and was the single most deciding factor for me buying not only a whole-ass Switch (OLED model too), but a copy of Metroid Dread, too.</p>\n<p>Firstly - the Switch is fantastic, so far. I really, really enjoy that I can use it both portably and as a console. I'm looking forward to check out its library (I've already bought Mario Odyssey, and will likely buy BotW at some point, too). I've heard it's gotten panned for its faulty controllers (Joycon drift), and honestly, yeah. That should be fixed, if it wasn't already. C'mon, Nintendo (and Sony, you too - apparently your PS5 controllers also have drifting - what's the matter with these issues?)</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n<p>I set the Switch up, spent a bit of time getting familiar with it, by virtue of playing Yoshi's Island (which, frankly, isn't a fun game upon replaying it). Once I've had enough of Yoshi, I booted Dread up. Man, was I glad I did so, cause what followed was an extremely fun time.</p>\n<p>I <em>did </em>spoil myself on the first 40 minutes or so, by virtue of watching <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/hypercole64\">Cole</a> play through it blind. I decided I wouldn't want to spoil myself any further after that point, and decided to drop the money on the console + game, as stated before.</p>\n<p>But... even then, playing it for <em>myself </em>was such a surreal experience. The game looked great, it sounded great, it <em>played </em>great. I was enjoying myself playing a brand-new game, the last time that happened was with Sonic Mania, an excellent game in its own right.</p>\n<p>I found the EMMI terrifying, as would anyone else, but also interesting. The first one being crippled, and more or less an excuse to show you both what an EMMI is, how you can get rid of it, and the area EMMI live in (also explained by Adam, to be fair), it's a facet of good, albeit a bit forceful design. This particular first one being crippled to hell and beyond definitely helped alleviate the stress that later ones came with, in hindsight.</p>\n<p>Defeating it felt good, and, if I'm remembering correctly, gave you a power up that lets you explore more of the area you're currently in, and get into new areas, too.</p>\n<p><em>I just realized </em>I completely skimmed over the intro - Samus gets into a fight with some sort of Chozo?, and she loses her powerups like that. We... have no idea what happened, and neither does she, apparently. I suppose we'll find out later, and find out later we shall.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Meat of the Game</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/dread1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-xs.png 300w ,https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-sm.png 480w ,https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-md.png 768w ,https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-lg.png 1024w ,https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-xl.png 1360w ,https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/responsive/dread1-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"Image capture of Metroid Dread\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></figure>\n<p>Honestly you probably don't need me to tell you this - it plays like a Metroid game. The new counter mechanic (to me, as I haven't played Samus Returns) is implemented well, I like that you're encouraged to master it as countering then killing an enemy nets you more health/missiles than a regular kill would. You also get upgrades not really seen in previous Metroid games, as is usually the case with new games, and they work well enough.</p>\n<p>There's new types of doors, too, ones that require different beams, for one. I honestly think this could've been executed better. I don't like opening grapple beam doors, I don't like using the grapple beam period honestly. But aside from that, we have a new type of morph ball, one that destroys blocks in a + pattern, and can also get you across pitfall blocks.</p>\n<p>A lot more devious setups using both old and new powerups are also located all across the game, especially speed booster puzzles - This game loves putting speed booster blocks in unconventional spots, and usually not for a huge reward, just missiles. In a sense, it makes it purely optional, as players playing casually <em>will </em>have health, missiles and whatnot required to beat the game, while people going for 100% will want to learn the setups and how to get them quickly... but, honestly, as a more casual player, that defeats the purpose for me. Why go for this puzzle/setup when the reward is just a few missiles? Sure, it's <em>nice, </em>but more energy is always more appreciated by me. Not to mention, puzzles that don't reveal what the reward is. There was a very devious speed booster puzzle, I barely got it while hurting my thumbs, and the reward was a measly pack of two missiles. Seriously?</p>\n<p>I 100%'d the first area of the game, Artaria, and I also 100%'d the last area, as it only had 3 items or so. Other areas varied between 50%-ish to 95%, and it was enough to get me 86% items upon clearing. I can always go back to 100% it, but I would rather do it on a new save and also get a faster time to boot, as 12 hours isn't that nice, but... that's for the next section, I believe.</p>\n<p>Gripe aside, I did enjoy the puzzles the game threw at you, there was no shortage of \"A-ha!\" moments, where a previously seemingly-impossible puzzle becomes possible. For one of those, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_melonadem/status/1450173574820470787\">I had to ask for help on Twitter</a>, but I feel that's natural with Metroidvanias, to an extent. I appreciate that MOST things are completable by yourself with enough dedication and some thought, I just wish everything was, haha.</p>\n<p>To help offset that, at least, there's plenty of instances where sequence-breaking is possible, not for big items but the smaller ones? It's chock full of them, and I have a feeling a lot of them were intentional, too. This ain't Mercury Steam's first rodeo at a Metroid game, anyhow, it's their second, and they clearly have a knack for this design philosophy, as they quite literally nailed it well here.</p>\n<p>Another thing I enjoyed seeing is plenty of recharge stations scattered throughout the map. They weren't bundled with save rooms or anything, and there were various kinda: energy, ammo, and total stations. Energy and Ammo are self-explanatory, total would recharge/refill both types. Teleporters, too. Makes for quick backtracking, barring the load times. I like how after you discover all teleporters, you can go to any teleporter, from any teleporter, similar to the Symphony of the Night teleportation, if I'm remembering right.</p>\n<p>Story wise, you're trying to return to your ship, and leave the planet. However, as you try to dwelve your way up to your ship, you're encountering more EMMI (which restore some of your abilities), finding Chozo statues (obtaining suits, beams and whatnot), and fighting bosses while trying to get out of here, essentially.</p>\n<p>Around the middle of the game, you encounter an actual Chozo?, which tries to help you out by disabling the remaining EMMI, but he gets killed by a new faction of enemies, the Mawkins. They're like Chozo, from what I can recall, but trying to resurrect Metroids, as it was their sign of greatness. You, as Samus Aran, are the only remaining being with Metroid DNA, and the guy at the beginning of the game wants to extract it from you. Essentially you were lured to ZDR via footage from an X parasite roaming around the planet, and Raven Beak (the bad guy from the intro) wants to harvest your DNA to once again create Metroids.</p>\n<p>As you blow up some form of research facility?, a ton of X parasites break out, infecting... everything on the planet, pretty much. The Chozo that helped you (that was dead) is revived, and turns the EMMI back on, basically you have to get away from them like you have been doing so far.</p>\n<p>One thing I kinda dislike, though, is how the EMMI become less and less relevant as the game reaches the end. The last one you don't even fight, you just... well, we shall get to that later. The last set of them are quickly defeated, and I don't know, they just stop being a constant threat when they were set up to be THE thing to be most fearful of at the intro. Maybe it's you becoming strong and that's a way the game uses to signify that, but still. It's at least better than the SA-X from Fusion in terms of terror and tension.</p>\n<p>The X parasites act the same as they have in Fusion, where you can absorb them (and where they can mutate into enemies, fuse and whatnot). I actually don't quite understand <em>why </em>they're here, but it doesn't matter too much, I guess.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>All Things Must Come to an End</h2>\n<p>While I have been somewhat critical here, it's purely because I love the series - despite those few flaws, I very much enjoyed myself. Let's talk about the ending parts.</p>\n<p>During the interlude between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, Samus went back on SR388 and got infected with the X parasite, we all know that. She got a specially-developed Metroid DNA vaccine that immediately cured her, but as a result she's also pretty much THE only living thing that contains any trace of a metroid. The BSL labs crashed on to SR388, blowing the planet up, eliminating the metroids that they were producing.</p>\n<p>The mawkins do not take kindly to this either - again, they saw metroids as THEIR magnum opus, as things that should rule every corner of the galaxy. You fight them a couple times throughout the game, either as actual mawkins or X-parasite infected ones that also do wacky crap.</p>\n<p>As you progress into Hanubia, you're... noticing something weird about yourself. You can sporadically and unpredictably start to suck energy out of anything living or not, and you're doing that with the last EMMI, too, just for good measure. It'd seem like Raven Beak was awakening the Metroid DNA within you, and well he did succeed. During your confrontation with him, it seems like every odd is stacked against you, but as things hit their most dire point... your powers awaken.</p>\n<p>Yes. Samus Aran turns into an actual Metroid. Not LITERALLY, but in spirit. Her suit even gains a very cool metroid theming and she's become very overpowered. There's a difference between her and actual Metroids, likely because this one would have a whole functioning cerebral system, while \"actual\" Metroids mindlessly hunt prey down. This is further embelished by Adam telling Samus \"don't\", when trying to operate the ship in her Metroid form.</p>\n<p>Now, one confusing thing... earlier in the game, we see that the Chozo dude has been infected with the X parasite, and starts re-enabling the EMMI to give Samus more to deal with, which makes sense? I guess? But in the ending, he's there, and... the parasite turns Samus back to normal? Does the X know it's powerless against Samus, and offers to help instead? It's weird and kind of confusing. We already do know that the X parasites clearly possess some form of intelligence, as seen in Fusion, and something similar DOES happen there, where the SA-X merges with you and gives you a proper ice-beam, for one.</p>\n<p>It's also unclear to me what the heck that last Adam conversation, right before the boss, was really about. Why did Adam start going about how \"his\" plan worked? Obviously it had to be hijacked to some extent by Raven Beak, but did he also do that for every other Adam conversation? Did he only do it for the bit where \"his plan worked\"? It's confusing, and while a Metroid game is not purely for the plot I still think it could have been handled a bit better, or given some explanation.</p>\n<p>Another thing... there's no epilogue. Just, your ship cruises off into the depths of space, leaving you with a clear time and a \"See you next mission!\"</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>I hope this game does well financially. I hope it shows Nintendo that Metroid is a popular franchise worth developing games for, and while I do not hope they pump out games yearly, like Capcom would with Mega Man in the early 90s, I hope it's something that occurs each new console generation.</p>\n<p>In terms of a rating, god, it's hard to say, really - maybe 8.5/10?? I'm not a critic with any significance, especially not for games, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>\n<p><strong>Graphics: 8/10</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Looks great, albeit jagged in some places, and oddly lower-res even docked. Frame drops are rare, it maintains a smooth 60fps in most cases.</li>\n<li>Handheld it looks great and not downscaled at all, at least to the naked eye.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sound: 9/10</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The music isn't exactly memorable, but it helps set up the mood and atmosphere for any particular scene. Underwater music is as serene as usual for Metroid, other areas have a motif of some sort, \"safe\" rooms have a clear release of tension, while EMMI zones are rightfully unnerving to travel in, with being spotted/heard evolving the music and making it even more chaotic.</li>\n<li>The sound design is fantastic, 10/10 for it alone, a TON of instances where the rumble helps sell this even more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Gameplay: 8/10</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It feels good to play. While I have a few quirks with the controls, they're ultimately nothing too major. Only time it got legitimately worse than that is when I was hunting for items and had to activate my speed booster, which was awkward to do and kinda painful in the worst of worst cases.</li>\n<li>The game is designed well for 90% of it, in most cases what was my fault WAS my fault, however the 10% was bosses that felt a bit too difficult for my liking, and the one part where Artaria is frozen over, and had to ask someone about how to progress from there. Turns out, I missed a block that was breakable in a pretty obvious spot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yeah, that'll do.</p>\n<p>See you next post!</p>",
