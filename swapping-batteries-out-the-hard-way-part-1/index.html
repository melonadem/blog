It's an entirely different world, however, when that is not the case, i.e. it's hard to access and/or replace. What can you do, in that case? Well...</p><h2>Enter The Hard Way</h2><p>It's often more expensive to buy a holder and solder that in, placing the battery separately, compared to just soldering in a battery type and going on your merry way to ship your product. Some companies understood this, and still decided to go for the holder method, as they knew those synthesizers would still be used years on (and, a lot of them are!). Roland, Korg and Yamaha were usually good about this, and if they weren't, a solder job is usually easy... that is, unless you're Alesis.</p><p>Alesis was not always known for synthesizers or any kind of sounds. They started off producing and building various PA equipment on the cheap. However, by the late 80s, they have branched out into other domains, notably in the drums department with their HR-16 drum machines, which were popular.</p><p>The HR-16's... used a weird battery type. Instead of a coin cell, like a typical CR2032, they opted for a big, bulky 3.6v battery that resembles a D cell more than anything, I'm not even sure if it is a D cell. Regardless, it served the same purpose as other batteries in products of this time: Provide power to a SRAM chip and preserve user settings or patterns.</p><p>By the 90s, Alesis shifted from those bulky batteries to more conventional 3V Lithium coin cell batteries. However, instead of using something more traditional, like a CR2032, they went with a BR2325 battery, and it was attached with tabs to the synths themselves. Giving credit where it's due, many Alesis products used this battery type: From SR-16s to Quadrasynths, to DM5s and DM-PROs.</p><p>In actuality, the BR2325 is not too dissimilar to the CR2032, both are Li-Ion batteries, both provide 3 volts of power, really the only difference is in its chemical build. CR batteries are more commonly available, but the BRs are able to sustain higher temperatures for longer. Regardless, what this means is, given the right holder, you can totally use a CR2032 in those synths, and users <em>have </em>done so in the past with their SR-16's. I might be the first example of doing this with a Quadrasynth S4 (and eventually a QSR too)</p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//alesis-s4.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-xs.jpg 300w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-sm.jpg 480w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-md.jpg 768w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-lg.jpg 1024w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-xl.jpg 1360w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4//responsive/alesis-s4-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="The synth in question, before surgical procedure" width="4032" height="829"><figcaption>The quiant Alesis S4, months before being out of function (replaced by QSR), also months before lobotomy.</figcaption></figure><p>For an early 1994 synth, it was quite capable - 64 total voices, a maximum of 4 could make up one program, and up to 16 of those could be played at once in a mix. While it had a diverse amount of sounds, it didn't compare to the contemporaries of the time like Roland's JV synths, or even Korg's Ai2 synths (the 01/W and derivatives) which released before the Quadrasynth. It still saw some success, enough to convince Alesis to keep going with it, and true to Alesis's track record, it was fairly inexpensive (and compact when talking about the S4).</p><p>Regardless, it and many other Alesis products of this era used the same BR2325 batteries, and getting to the battery requires disassembling the entire synth completely. Remove the top, the bottom, the side ears... disconnect the front panel (which I would have wanted to do anyway, this S4 in particular has some really non-functioning buttons and knobs, hoping some contact cleaner will solve the issue. This'll all be concluded in part 2)</p><p>Anyway, the synth was taken fully apart, and I could finally get to the battery. This was my first time soldering, and honestly it shows cause I snipped the dang thing off and then removed the legs, and it wasn't a particularly clean job. I even scratched a bit of the PCB, but no problem, it'll be covered up by the holder.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/s4-battery-layout.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-xs.jpg 300w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-sm.jpg 480w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-md.jpg 768w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-lg.jpg 1024w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-xl.jpg 1360w, https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/responsive/s4-battery-layout-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="Layout of the battery in the S4" width="838" height="664"><figcaption>The BR2325 has 3 terminals, two positive (shown on the left hand side, with one being unused) and one negative (on the right hand side)</figcaption></figure><p>The battery layout was a bit of a brain-scratcher, but it turns out some Alesis products use the other pin (unused here) for the positive connection. I haven't encountered a situation where both are going to be used at the same time, so this pin can just remain unconnected. There are no traces leading through, or to it, so it should be fine. Here's hoping.</p><p>Either way - the battery holder will have to be connected slightly diagonally, but that should be fine. It should fit just fine, as a CR2032 is a smaller diameter than BR2325.</p><p>CR/BR denotes the battery chemicals, 20/23 denote the diameter in millimeters/mm, 32/25 denote the thickness in tenths of millimeters, so a CR2032 is a CR-type battery with a 20mm diameter and a 3.2mm thickness, BR2325 is a BR-type battery with a 23mm diameter and a 2.5mm thickness.</p><h2>Planning for the Future</h2><p>I could just have ordered an identical, brand-new replacement, but the prices on <em>those </em>are extraordinarily high - £14 for <em>one </em>god-damned battery, with another £15 for postage. That is absurd, I got a CR2032 holder for... £2, with free shipping, and I have spare CR2032 batteries that are brand new.</p><p>Moreso, using a holder will make it easier to change out the battery when it goes bad again. Sure, by then, maybe an IC will have failed, rendering the synth useless, or if not an IC, a capacitor somewhere, whose juices will have corroded some important traces, meaning it needs a trip to the solder doctor somewhere. I could do that, but I'm not sure if a new owner would bother doing so, and might just throw it away.</p><p>...Perhaps it's time we start preserving the Quadrasynth line beyond restoring the original boxes or keyboards, by making a softsynth version of some kind. Only time can tell, but I wish I knew DSP programming and how to work with ICs, dumping ROM data and doing <em>something </em>with it...</p><p>Either way, in part 2 I'm going to place the new holder, repair the front panel, put it all back together and pray that it works. If it does, then it's going to go to a friend overseas. If it doesn't, well it was still worth a shot, and now that I have this soldering equipment, I might try to create something using it. Only time can tell.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 6, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/tags/90s/">90s</a></li><li><a href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/tags/mels-workshop/">mels-workshop</a></li><li><a href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/tags/rackmount/">rackmount</a></li><li><a href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/tags/synths/">synths</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F&amp;via=%40_melonadem&amp;text=Swapping%20Batteries%20Out%3A%20The%20Hard%20Way%20(Part%201)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F4%2Fs4-takenapartsolder.jpg&amp;description=Swapping%20Batteries%20Out%3A%20The%20Hard%20Way%20(Part%201)" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Swapping%20Batteries%20Out%3A%20The%20Hard%20Way%20(Part%201)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Swapping%20Batteries%20Out%3A%20The%20Hard%20Way%20(Part%201) https%3A%2F%2Fmelonadem.github.io%2Fblog%2Fswapping-batteries-out-the-hard-way-part-1%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/media/website/rox.png" loading="lazy" alt="Mel"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://melonadem.github.io/blog/authors/mel/" class="invert" rel="author">Mel</a></h3><p>MelonadeM is a 21 year-old composer and producer.
